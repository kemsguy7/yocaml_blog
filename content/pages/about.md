Hi there! 👋 I'm **Joy Aruku**, a passionate software engineer with a deep love for functional programming, elegant code, and building beautiful web experiences.

## What I Do

I specialize in:

- **Functional Programming** - Particularly OCaml and type-driven development
- **Static Site Generation** - Building fast, efficient websites with YOCaml
- **Web Development** - Creating beautiful, responsive user interfaces
- **Technical Writing** - Sharing knowledge and helping others learn

## My Journey

My journey into programming started with a curiosity about how things work. That curiosity led me to discover functional programming, and I haven't looked back since. OCaml's powerful type system and elegant syntax captured my imagination, and I've been exploring its ecosystem ever since.

## Why This Blog?

This blog is my space to:

- Share what I'm learning about OCaml, YOCaml, and functional programming
- Document my projects and experiments
- Connect with other developers who share similar interests
- Contribute to the growing OCaml community

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

- Reading about programming language theory
- Exploring new technologies and frameworks
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Enjoying good coffee ☕

## Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, especially those interested in functional programming. Feel free to reach out through the [contact page](/contact.html) or follow my work on GitHub.
